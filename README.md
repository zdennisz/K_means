# K means 

K means algorithm implmeneted in python and cpp in order to show the differences in speed of processing the data.
The data set is 100 points with x,y coordinates within each one point.

The algorithem is explained well in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering.
The algorithem in python is run via http://www.codeskulptor.org/ online python enviroment.</br>
In the Python algo, as it can be seen I have circled the centers of the clusters that were found and after apporx. 12 iterations of the algorithm stopped since the center of the clusters stopped changing significantly.

The time that it took for the algo to finish without the drawing of the clustsers is

It is clearly seen that the cpp language is much faster in computing that data compared to python.</br>

:warning: Disclaimer :warning:</br>
The algorithm is implemented in a very simplistic way, hence if one to implement it in a different way and get different results.
